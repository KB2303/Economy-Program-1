"""
An interactive tech demo to teach economics.
Goals for this program:
Your success in the simulation is based on your total score as well as your final year score
Do better in these than in a simulation with no changes added, and you will be a winner
The only variable that needs changing should be the OS directory. Usually a subfolder exists
below the economy folder but my understanding of GitHub prevents me from doing this.
Any questions should be directed to my GitHub project. Constructive criticism is appreciated
especially from a data analysis standpoint as that is the direction this project is going towards
The average score for the game is equal to playing it with no tax tampering whatsoever
This is equal to:TOTAL_SCORE = 90348800000 VALUE_OF_TOWN = 1129360000
